# Employee-Form
In this Employee form, I make a form for employee details like his/her name, email, contact number, job title and salary. We can add further for user requirement. And Other file is (db_con.php) for connection to database. Latly I create (save_details.php) for insert our data in phpmyadmin through Insert query.
